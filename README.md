# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo
## Mia Soza


I've always wanted to learn more about web development, coding -- specifically, how the two are used in design. The only real experience I've had with coding came from messing around with the HTML on my blog page, waaaaay back in middle school...

## Q+A with the Internet
- I thought it was a super neat coincidence that the first message successfully sent over the internet happened just 100 days after our moon landing.
- For the longest time I had assumed that "web" was just slang for the internet -- not that the two were separate parts of a greater whole.
- The internet is ACTUALLY (at some point) a wire in the ground! What! I know it's plenty more complicated than that, but I figured after the death of dial up we'd switched over to... The cloud?
